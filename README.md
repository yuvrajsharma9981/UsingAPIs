# UsingAPIs
This project contains three different assignments that I have done while learning how to work with APIs. Twitter_search - This part of project ask user for a query and since Id, and depending upon them query the twitterAPI and return the top 100 tweets in form of a table TwitterDatabase - This project was the expansion of the twitter_search project, where I query the twitter API on the topic election, set the timer, keep repeating the query and collected 5000 tweets in a local database, from where I tried to query the database and retrive tweets to answered three things in form of table, on the choice of user, - tweets on bernie, tweets on clinton,and tweets on trump. NYTimes - This project was the further extension of the project TwitterDatabase, in this I used the article search New York Times API. I retrive the first 1000 tweets from the database, and count the frequency fo each word in, remove the words with 3 or less characters, then count the top 3 words with the highest frequency, query them to NYT API and present the listof articles in form of table with the time stamp and original article.
